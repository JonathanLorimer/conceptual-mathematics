- Week 1
  - Article 2.i: Isomorphisms - isomorphisms
- Week 2
  - Article 2.ii: Isomorphisms - choice and determination
  - Article 2.iii: Isomorphisms - retracts, sections, and idempotents
- Week 3
  - Article 2.iv: Isomorphisms - isomorphisms and automorphisms
  - Discussion:
    - Every section has a retraction and every retraction has a section
    - Sections and retractions are two parts of an inverse
    - Every section maps from a smaller object to a larger object (embeds)
    - Every retraction maps from a larger object to a smaller object (exemplifies)
    - If a function f has a section s and a retraction r then r = s; f has an inverse which is both the section and retraction f-1 = r = s
    - Isomorphisms give us a notion of equal cardinality, we can use this to prove that for A -f-> B there are as many isomorphisms f as there are automorphisms on A
  - Day 2
    - Categories can pack a lot more structure than `SET` can! Eg, `PERM`
        requires a big commuting square for all its morphisms, and these are
        quite restrictive. It took us 30 minutes to find a `PERM` morphism!
    - A permutation morphism needs to preserve cycles. For every cycle in the
        domain, there must be a cycle *of the same length* in the codomain.
    - The embed / exemplify metaphor for sections and retractions are a really
        good intuition! They hold in `PERM` too!
